# Tetris

This Tetris clone was my first project using the Windows API and my first experience working outside of a game engine. I built everything from scratch in C++, including rendering shapes, handling input, managing game state, and implementing the game loop. The project taught me how engines work under the hood and gave me a solid foundation in low level programming. It also sparked my interest in more advanced graphics, eventually leading me to experiment with OpenGL. While it wasn’t optimized or elegant, it was a major milestone in my growth as a programmer. Without this project, I don’t think most of my future projects would exist.
